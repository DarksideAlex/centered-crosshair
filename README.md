# Centered Crosshair

Fixes the annoying bug where the center of the crosshair doesn't actually match the center of the screen.

Example (Red Cross = Screen Center):

<table>
<tr>
<th>Vanilla Minecraft</th><th>With the Mod</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TGEMXhx.png" width="300" alt="picture of the crosshair offcenter">
</td>
<td>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qezdiBT.png" width="300" alt="picture of the crosshair in the center">
</td>
</tr>
</table>

If the crosshair is an uneven number of pixels wide (e.g. 3), it will still be offcenter but just by one pixel.
